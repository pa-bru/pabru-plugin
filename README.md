# pabru-plugin
plugin created as part of CMS course taught in my school.

This plugin enables you to create and display customized maps.

You can already add :
- an address (required)
- a map title
- a description of the map
- a title in the context box (of the marker, you just have to click on it to display the box)
- a text in the context box (of the marker)
- a link at the end of the context box (of the marker)

Version 1.0, soon you will have more choices and cool features !
This plugin is indeed destined to evolve !
